    <h2>Course Overview</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this course is to teach operating system design
        from a research point of view.
        We will go over key topics of operating systems,
          walk through the evolution of many different operating systems techniques,
          and examine their usage in both important historical
        systems and in modern systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will be going over the following topics:
        <ul>
            <li>Historical Perspectives</li>
        <!--
            <li>Unix and Plan 9 (and MINIX and Linux)</li>
        -->
            <li>Microkernel and Library OS</li>
            <li>Synchronization</li>
            <li>Scheduling</li>
            <li>Memory Management</li>
            <li>Virtualization</li>
            <li>Storage and File Systems</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a research-oriented seminar course with a major research project.
        In short, the course is about discussing and learning (by doing!) computer systems research.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Prerequisite:</b> CS 423, ECE 391, CS 425, and CS 433 (or equivalent).
        Take the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2AoARPUVzMcywiZOGt4fr3AHlFGhqg-q86WYB67pbM" target="_blank">Prerequisite Quiz</a> if you are not sure.
    </p>

    <h2>Reading List</h2>

    <p> The course does not have a textbook. Instead, the course material will
      come from research papers, articles, and online resources.
      We will have assigned papers to read and discuss them in the class.
      You are expected to read these papers <i>before</i> coming to class,
      and be prepared to discuss them.
    </p>

    </ul>
-->
    <p>
      I highly recommend you to read <a class="paperlink" href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html" target="_blank">Griswold's
      advices on how to read a research paper</a>.
      The take-home message is that until you can answer a bunch of questions,
      you are not done reading a paper.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also strongly encourage you to discuss the papers with other students in
        the class â€” you may have insights that others do not, and vice versa.
        Oftentimes, students form reading groups, which I heartily encourage;
        on the other hand, I would like to point out that
        group discussion is not an effective substitute
        for actually reading the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need a textbook to review and catch background, I recommend
      <a class="paperlink" href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/" target="_blank">the OSTEP book</a>.

    </p>

    <p>
        For this semester, we will emphasize more on hands-on research projects than paper reading.
    </p>

    <h2>Class Participation</h2>

    <p>
        Since this is a research-based course, class participation is required.
        We (everyone) will discuss the papers and our research progress in class. 
        Note that your performance in class form <b>10%</b> of your overall grade,
        so it does matter that you both show up to class and participate in the discussion.
    </p>
<!--
    <ul>
        <li> What problem does the paper address?</li>
        <li> How is it different from previous work, if any?</li>
        <li> What is the approach used to solve the problem?</li>
        <li> How does the paper support or otherwise justify its arguments and conclusions?</li>
        <li> Was the paper, in your judgement, successful in addressing the problem?</li>
        <li> How can I continue this work?</li>
    </ul>
-->
    <h2>Research Project</h2>

    <p>
        The best way to learn is by doing. 
        For this semester, we will do a research project together and
        you will also have the opportunity to undertake your own research project.
        We will discuss (and debate) our progress and results during the class. 
    <!--
        A group with a size larger than two is not encouraged, but is possible if
          you have a strong justification that the project needs more members.
        I will provide a list of ideas to get you started thinking,
          but I highly encourage you to pursue your own ideas
          which typically lead to better results.
    -->
        You will write a project report and present it at the end of the course.
        The details of the research project will be announced later.
    </p>

       You can find <a href="../pub.html" target="_blank">a list of 523 projects that were
       subsequently published in workshops, conferences, and journals</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not release
      information that are not opened to public to protect students' work
      (many of which are closely connected to their thesis research).
    </p>
-->
    <p>
        You are expected to be aware of
        <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html" target="_blank">Academic
          Integrity Guidelines</a> of the University of Illinois.
          Any violation of the course or university policies
          will be treated seriously, and could lead to severe repercussions.
          Pleae don't cheat. It's not worth it.
    </p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>
        There is no midterm or final exams.
        The course is about discussing Systems research (10%) and doing Systems research (90%).
        We will have assignments every week and discuss the progress at the Thursday class.
        There are two labs, each contributing to 25%.
        <ul>
            <li>10%: Class Discussion</li>
            <li>25%:  Lab 1</li>
            <li>25%:  Lab 2</li>
            <li>40%:  Mini research project</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Credit</h2>
    <p>
        This course is designed based on CSE 221 (Graduate
        Operating Systems) taught at University of California at San Diego
        (where I did my PhD).
        It was my favourite course during my grad school -- I took it and TA-ed
        for it multiple times with different professors including
            Geoff Voelker, Yuanyuan Zhou, and Stefan Savage.
        They should take the credits for the course design.
