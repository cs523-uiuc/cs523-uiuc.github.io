    <h2>Reports and Code</h2>

    <p> <b>Proposal:</b> Your project proposal should describe what you plan to
      do, why it is interesting, how you plan to do it, and what you are not
      sure about. Also describe what resources you think you will need to carry
      out the project (e.g., VMs, datasets).
      The end product of the proposal is a crisp <b>problem statement</b>.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Checkpoint #1:</b> Your checkpoint report should describe your progress
      on achieving the goals you included in your proposal.
      Clearly explain any changes you have made to the goal of your project
      based on your experience so far.
      Also, provide a concrete plan of what you will need to accomplish in the
      remaining weeks to complete your project.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Checkpoint #2:</b> Similar as Checkpoint #1.
      And what's more,
      you must include primary results (e.g., small-scale measurement results,
      examples that your prototype can already handle, etc).
    </p>

    <p> <b>Final paper:</b> Your final paper should be written like a research
      paper you read in class. Your paper must be no longer than 6 pages. 
      The paper can include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Final submission:</b> Submit your reports and code to the instructor and TAs via email.</p>

    <p> <b>Code:</b> The simplest way is to host your project repository
      at GitHub or BitBucket,
      and add the instructor and TAs as the collaboators.
      It is ok if you want to keep your code confidential,
      but please talk to us explicitly.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Paper/report format:</b> Please format your report using
      <a href="https://github.com/cs523-uiuc/final_report_template">this template</a>.
      Reports formatted with other templates are invalid. 
    </p>
    
    <p> <b>Final presentation:</b> Please prepare a <font color="red">12-minute</font> presentation and record your presentation (do not exceed 12 minutes and we have penality for that).
        Checkout <a class="paperlink" href="https://piazza.com/class/kdxjsy8bvg94iy?cid=48" target="_blank">this Piazza post</a> on 
        how to make the video using zoom and send the instructor and TAs the video link.

    <h2>Project Ideas</h2>

    I will provide a list of ideas to get you started thinking,
      but I highly encourage you to pursue your own ideas
      which typically lead to better results.

    The ideas will be posted on Piazza.
