    <h2>Course Overview</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this course is to teach operating system design
        from a research point of view.
        We will go over key topics of operating systems,
          walk through the evolution of many different operating systems techniques,
          and examine their usage in both important historical
        systems and in modern systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will be going over the following topics:
        <ul>
            <li>Historical Perspectives</li>
            <li>Unix and Plan 9 (and MINIX and Linux)</li>
            <li>Microkernel</li>
            <li>Library OS</li>
            <li>Synchronization</li>
            <li>Scheduling</li>
            <li>Memory Management</li>
            <li>Virtualization</li>
            <li>Storage and File Systems</li>
            <li>Distributed Systems</li>
            <li>Reliability</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a research-oriented seminar course with a major course project.
        In short, the course is about discussing and learning (by doing!) computer system research.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Prerequisite:</b> CS 423, ECE 391, CS 425, and CS 433 (or equivalent).
        Take the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2AoARPUVzMcywiZOGt4fr3AHlFGhqg-q86WYB67pbM" target="_blank">Prerequisite Quiz</a> if you are not sure.
    </p>

    <h2>Reading List</h2>

    <p> The course does not have a textbook. Instead, the course material will
      come from seminal, noteworthy, or representative research papers and articles.
      Each lecture (except the first one) will have two assigned
      papers to read.
      You are expected to read these papers <i>before</i> coming to class,
      and be prepared to discuss them. We will also list
      recommended readings; you are encouraged to read those, but not required.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="readings.html" target="_blank">Schedule and Reading List</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I highly recommend you to read <a class="paperlink" href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html" target="_blank">Griswold's
      advices on how to read a research paper</a>.
      The take-home message is that until you can answer a bunch of questions,
      you are not done reading a paper.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also strongly encourage you to discuss the papers with other students in
        the class — you may have insights that others do not, and vice versa.
        Oftentimes, students form reading groups, which I heartily encourage;
        on the other hand, I would like to point out that
        group discussion is not an effective substitute
        for actually reading the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need a textbook to review and catch background, I recommend
      <a class="paperlink" href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/" target="_blank">the OSTEP book</a>.

    </p>

    <h2>Class Participation</h2>

    <p>
        Since this is a discuss-based course, class participation is required.
        We will discuss the papers and articles that we will have all read
        before each class. I will lead discussions by asking questions of
        students at random in class. Note that your performance in class
        form <b>10%</b> of your overall grade,
        so it does matter that you both show up to class and participate in the discussion (which
          in fact requires you to read the papers).
        The questions are essentially in the following forms:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> What problem does the paper address?</li>
        <li> How is it different from previous work, if any?</li>
        <li> What is the approach used to solve the problem?</li>
        <li> How does the paper support or otherwise justify its arguments and conclusions?</li>
        <li> Was the paper, in your judgement, successful in addressing the problem?</li>
        <li> How can I continue this work?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research Project</h2>

    <p>
        The best way to learn is by doing. You will undertake <i>your own</i> research
        project <b>individually</b> or <b>in a group of two</b>.
        A group with a size larger than two is not encouraged, but is possible if
          you have a strong justification that the project needs more members.
        I will provide a list of ideas to get you started thinking,
          but I highly encourage you to pursue your own ideas
          which typically lead to better results.
        You will write a project report and present it at the end of the course.
        The details of the research project is described in the following link.

       You can find <a href="../pub.html" target="_blank">a list of 523 projects that were
       subsequently published in workshops, conferences, and journals</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not release
      information that are not opened to public to protect students' work
      (many of which are closely connected to their thesis research).
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: You are expected to be aware of
        <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html" target="_blank">Academic
          Integrity Guidelines</a> of the University of Illinois.
          Any violation of the course or university policies
          will be treated seriously, and could lead to severe repercussions.
          Pleae don't cheat. It's not worth it.
    </p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>
        There is no homework, no midterm, no final exams.
        The course is about discussing Systems research (10%) and doing Systems research (90%).
        Note that the Project Proposal, Checkpoint Report 1, and Checkpoint Report 2 account for 5%, 5%, and 5%, respectively.
        <ul>
            <li>10%: Class Discussion</li>
            <li>5%:  Project Proposal</li>
            <li>5%:  Checkpoint Report 1</li>
            <li>5%:  Checkpoint Report 2</li>
            <li>75%:  Final Project Report and Presentation</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Credit</h2>
    <p>
        This course is designed based on CSE 221 (Graduate
        Operating Systems) taught at University of California at San Diego
        (where I did my PhD).
        It was my favourite course during my grad school -- I took it and TA-ed
        for it multiple times with different professors including
            Geoff Voelker, Yuanyuan Zhou, and Stefan Savage.
        They should take the credits for the course design.
