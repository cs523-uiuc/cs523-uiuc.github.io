    <h2>Course Overview</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this course is to teach operating system design
        from a research point of view.
        We will go over key topics of operating systems,
          walk through the evolution of many different operating systems techniques,
          and examine their usage in both important historical
        systems and in modern systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will be going over the following topics:
        <ul>
            <li>Historical Perspectives</li>
            <li>Unix and Plan 9 (and MINIX and Linux)</li>
            <li>Microkernel</li>
            <li>Library OS</li>
            <li>Synchronization</li>
            <li>Scheduling</li>
            <li>Memory Management</li>
            <li>Virtualization</li>
            <li>Storage and File Systems</li>
            <li>Communication</li>
            <li>Distribution</li>
            <li>Protection</li>
            <li>Reliability</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a research-oriented seminar course with a major course project.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prerequisite: CS 423, CS 425, and CS 433 (or equivalent).
        Take the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2AoARPUVzMcywiZOGt4fr3AHlFGhqg-q86WYB67pbM" target="_blank">Prerequisite Quiz</a> if you are not sure.
    </p>

    <h2>Reading List</h2>

    <p> The course does not have a textbook. Instead, the course material will
      come from seminal, noteworthy, or representative papers and articles from
      the literature. Each lecture (except the first) will have two assigned
      papers to read, typically including one from academia and the other
      from industry.
      You should read these papers <i>before</i> coming to class,
      and be prepared to discuss them. Occasionally I will also list
      recommended readings; you are encouraged to read those, but not required.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="readings.html" target="_blank">Reading list and schedule (tentative)</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I highly recommend you to read <a class="paperlink" href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html" target="_blank">Griswold's
      advices on how to read a research paper</a>.
      The take-home message is that until you can answer a bunch of questions,
      you are not done reading a paper.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also strongly encourage you to discuss the papers with other students in
        the class — you may have insights that others do not, and vice versa.
        Often students form reading groups, which I heartily encourage.
        Note that group discussion, however, is not an effective substitute
        for actually reading the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are required to write reviews for the assigned papers.
      The review form (which consists of a number of questions) will be posted at
      Piazza.
      The review is due <b>11:59pm Tue/Thu</b> (the day before the class day).
      The paper reviews contribute to 10% of your overall grade.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need a textbook to review and catch background, I recommend
      <a class="paperlink" href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/" target="_blank">the OSTEP book</a>.

    </p>

    <h2>Class Participation</h2>

    <p>
        Since this is a discuss-based course, class participation is required.
        We will discuss the papers and articles that we will have all read
        before each class. I will lead discussions by asking questions of
        students at random in class. Note that your answers to these questions
        form 10% of your overall grade,
        so it is important that you both show up to class as well as read the papers.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> What problem does the paper address?</li>
        <li> How is it different from previous work, if any?</li>
        <li> What is the approach used to solve the problem?</li>
        <li> How does the paper support or otherwise justify its arguments and conclusions?</li>
        <li> Was the paper, in your judgement, successful in addressing the problem?</li>
        <li> How can I continue this work?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research Project</h2>

    <p>
        The best way to learn is by doing. You will undertake your own research
        project individually or in a group of two to three.
        I will provide a list of ideas to get you started thinking (cf. the project page),
        but I highly encourage you to pursue your own ideas.
        You will write a project report and present it at the end of the course.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="project.html" target="_blank">Project description</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You are expected to be aware of UIUC's
        <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html" target="_blank">academic
          integrity guidelines</a>. Any violation of the course or university policies
          will be treated seriously, and could lead to severe repercussions.
          Don't cheat. It's not worth it.
    </p>

    <h2>Credit</h2>
    <p>
        This course is designed based on CSE 221 (Graduate
        Operating Systems) taught at University of California at San Diego
        (where I did my PhD).
        It was my favourite course during my grad school -- I took it and TA-ed
        for it multiple times with different professors including
          Prof. Geoff Voelker, Prof. Yuanyuan Zhou,
        and Prof. Stefan Savage.
        They should take the credits for the course design.
