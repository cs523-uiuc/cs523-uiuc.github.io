  <h1>CSE 523: Project - Container Measurement</h1>
  <h2 class="h1sub">Fall 2019</h2>
  <a href="index.html">home</a>/<a href="project.html">project</a>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  This project is created to deepen your understanding about application performance in 
  cloud-native environment, you need to expose yourself to modern container techniques including
  Docker, gVisor, Firecracker, Kata Container, etc., by measuring and comparing their performance 
  against each other and bare metal. 
  <br><br>
  In this project, you will create, justify, and apply a set 
  of experiments to different systems to characterize and understand their performances. In addition, you may 
  explore the relations between some of these quantities. In doing so, you will study how to use 
  benchmarks to usefully characterize a complex system. You should also gain an intuitive feel for 
  the relative speeds of different basic operations, which is invaluable in identifying performance 
  bottlenecks.
  <br><br>
  You have complete choice over the operation system and 
  hardware platform for your measurements. You can use your 
  laptop that you are comfortable with, an operating system 
  running in a virtual machine monitor, a smartphone, a game 
  system, or even a supercomputer. You need to apply <b>the same 
  performance benchmarks</b> on <b>bare mental</b> and <b>two container 
  techniques</b>.
  <br><br>
  This project has two parts. 
  First, you will implement and perform a series of experiments. 
  Second, you will write a report documenting the methodology and results of your experiments. 
  When you finish, you will submit your report as well as the code used to perform your experiments.
